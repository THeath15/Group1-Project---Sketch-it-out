Selected Topic:  Market volatility during international conflict 

Reason topic was selected:
The current war between Ukraine and Russia has sent ripples through global financial markets,  our team has agreed and  decided to look  on investor outlook to war and uncertainty during international conflicts.

Description of source of Data / Other Resources:
The Mapping can be found here:  https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/ucdpprio/ucdp-prio-acd-211.pdf
Stock Market Dataset:  https://www.kaggle.com/rishidamarla/stock-prices-over-a-30-year-period 
Our initial exploratory dataset has 2507 datapoints saved in excel file format with filename: war_dataset.xls

Questions we hope to answer with the data: (In progress...team to add/edit)(In progress...team to add/edit)
	What was the market behavior prior to the conflict? 
	What was it during the conflict?  
	Did the size of the conflict have a proportional impact on the market price?
	Was a certain sector impacted more than another?


Description of data exploration  and  analysis phase of the project:
Draft: Data search  using Google browser and  Kaggle website (see above resources used for this project). We matched the  start year of downloaded Stock prices file and  UCDP /Prio Armed Conflict Dataset version  21.1  and we saved the filtered data set under filename:war_dataset.xls
