☒  Description of source of Data / Other Resources and Links:
	The Mapping can be found here:  https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/index.html#armedconflict-dataset-version-21.1.csv
	Stock Market Dataset:  https://www.kaggle.com/rishidamarla/stock-prices-over-a-30-year-period 
Our initial exploratory dataset has ___ datapoints saved in excel file format with filename: war_dataset.xls

☒ Questions we hope to answer with the data (reflecting on dataset)

a.	What was the market behavior prior to the conflict? 

b.	What was it during the conflict?  

c.	Did the size of the conflict have a proportional impact on the market price?

d.	Was a certain sector impacted more than another?

e.	Which territory or location was greatly affected by and what was minimum,  maximum and average market value during the conflict?

f.	Does the market bounce back after 90 days from the start of the conflict?
										 
☒ Description of data exploration  and  analysis phase of the project
Data search using UCDP Dataset Download Center (Department of Peace and Conflict Research) and  Kaggle website (see above resources used for this project). Dataset Stock Market Dataset and the war dataset from url above were downloaded and saved as:
Dowjones.csv
Nasdaq. csv
SP500.csv  
War_dataset.csv

Data was downloaded and cleaned.  The cleaning and merging process has been very challenging.  The dates of the conflicts versus the dates of the market data do not align easily as it is weekly not daily.  Narrowing the conflict data has been a timely process with many listed without dates along with conflict details.  Challenges have been in date formatting between files and aligning them together.
Using Jupyter Notebook/Python, scripts for cleaning up war dataset file was initiated and joining and cleaning up database for the 3 stock market file for Dowjones, Nasdaq and SP500.
