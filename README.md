**Project activity check-list:**

- [x] Create Repository for the project and invite the other team members to join

- [x] Source a data set that will suit your needs (use multiple sets if applicable)

- [x] Begin to clean, analyze and perform exploratory data analysis 

- [x] Include mockups of machine learning model and database.

**Project Rubrics:**
**Presentation: (30)** pts Note: The content does not yet need to be in the form of a presentation; text in the README.md works as well. 30 pts

- [x] Selected Topic: Market volatility during international conflict

- [x] Questions we hope to answer with the data (reflecting on dataset)
	 - What was the market behavior prior to the conflict? 
	 - What was it during the conflict?  
	 - Did the size of the conflict have a proportional impact on the market price?
	 - Was a certain sector impacted more than another?
	 - More questions to add and or finalize by the team…
