Variables used in the Armed Conflict Dataset – briefly review slide
Market Trend by Region Dashboard
First we have a location map by # of conflicts and as you put your cursor over each location you can see the location name, region name, type of conflict, and the number of conflicts. The dataset consists of data from 1977 through 2017.
As you can see the country with the most conflict is India with 121 conflicts
Briefly describe the 3 different types of conflict high level
Type of Conflict by Region
Describe the table based on the different regions & types of conflict each have had
Yearly # of Conflicts by Region
This table shows by year when each region had conflict
If you notice that Africa has had the most conflicts from 1977 through 2017 but in the map above India which is part of Asia has had the most conflict that is because Africa is made up of a many different locations
I would also like to point out that the largest dot for Americas was in 2001 which was from 9/11
We found during our data analysis there does not seem to be a correlation between international conflict and Dow Jones, NASDAQ, & S&P 500 unless the conflict directly involves the USA.
Actual 9/11/2001 Market Change (describe drop and increase)
Machine Learning Predicted 9/11/2001 Market Change
